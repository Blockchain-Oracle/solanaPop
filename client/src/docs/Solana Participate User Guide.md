## Introduction

The Solana POP platform allows event organizers to create and distribute Proof-of-Participation tokens (cTokens) on the Solana blockchain. These tokens serve as digital proof that someone attended or participated in an event, similar to digital badges or certificates.

### Key Features

- **For Event Creators**: Create and manage participation tokens for your events
- **For Event Attendees**: Collect tokens by scanning QR codes at events
- **Solana Integration**: Tokens exist on the Solana blockchain for transparency and ownership
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for both creators and attendees

---

### Distributing Tokens

There are several ways to distribute your QR codes to event attendees:
